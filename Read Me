🐾 Pet Adoption & Care Center Database

📌 Project Title
Pet Adoption & Care Center Management System (MySQL)

🐶 Description
This project simulates a full-featured relational database for managing a pet shelter and adoption center. It includes structured tables to manage pets, breeds, adoption applications, confirmed adoptions, veterinarians, and care history. The system is designed to improve operations by tracking the availability of pets, monitoring medical care, managing adoption processes, and recording vet visits and treatment notes. It mimics the real-life workflow of an adoption center to support better decision-making and record-keeping.
